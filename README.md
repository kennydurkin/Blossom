### *"What a strange thing! To be alive beneath cherry blossoms."* ~Kobayashi Issa

Blossom is a small service I wrote to keep track of how far along the cherry blossoms are at the [Brooklyn Botanical Gardens](http://www.bbg.org/collections/cherries). Essentially it scrapes the data from their site, updated daily, and sends an SMS using Twilio to each number is in its queue, stored on a server. The script runs everyday at noon to remind me that time is running out to see them!
